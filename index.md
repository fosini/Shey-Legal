#### INTRODUCTION

Effective date: July 15, 2018
Welcome to Shey ("Shey," "we," "us" or "our"). Shey provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through our content-sharing platform. 

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, videos, notifications, views and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at https://fosini.github.io/Shey-ToS/).

Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").
Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Shey services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.



#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect the following types of information:

- **Information you provide us directly:**
Your account name, phone-number, password and backup password when you register for an Shey account.

Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and/or last name,  picture). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Shey.

User Content (e.g., photos, videos, notifications, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
Communications between you and Shey. For example, we may send you Service-related messages (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related phone numbers.


- **Log-file informations:**
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your initial request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device type (Phone and OS Version), how you interact with content on the Service, content you viewed, and other such information. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.



#### HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We only use your information for service improvements and to keep your account secure. 


#### HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
Shey does not share any information with a third party entity. However, if you encounter a bug in our services, we might transfer your Log-Files (IP and Device-Type) to help fix the encountered bug as fast as possible.


#### HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR USER CONTENT:

Following termination or deactivation of your account, Shey, its Affiliates, or its Service Providers may retain information (including your profile information) and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes. It takes a minimum of 90 days to fully delete your account. The deletion of your account (and all of its associated content) will also occur when our services are being shut-down.


#### CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:

Shey does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service without parental admission. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.

#### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

Shey may modify or update this Privacy Policy, the link to the Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review and search for it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Instagram or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
